# libft ðŸ“š

In this project you'll reimplement a set of standard C library functions and include additional utility functions for memory handling, string manipulation, linked list operations, and more. This project emphasizes understanding low-level programming, memory management, and building reliable, reusable code without relying on the standard C library.

In future projects you are only allowed to use your own libft library instead of the standard C library.
